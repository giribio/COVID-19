## Welcome to ADMET Modelling Supporting Information with Experimental data references

To start with SAR modelling, you could experimental datapoints for A-D-M-E/T & PK properties from my literature library 
https://www.mendeley.com/community/admet-experimental-refs/

Feel free to use any dataset of your choice.
Please check back references for data authenticity and experimental observations.



#### The parameters for checkpoints are:

A) Model generation - i) pharmacokinetic properties (from published data) models to generate threshold range and optimal balance of properties to be considered for candidate selection criteria. 

B) Deriving medicinal chemistry properties as well as the synthetic feasibility and accessibility for novel molecules.

C) Model quality - i) parameters to define the model quality, applicability domain, reproducibility and reliability.

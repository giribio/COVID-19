Comparative analysis of approved drugs on S-protein of COVID-19 using computational strategies

Girinath G. Pillai*, P. Ambili Unni.

All protein target details are given in the 'protein' directory.

We performed molecular docking studies on 30 possible approved drugs, FDA approved drug, CAS ~50k antiviral compounds and natural compounds.

The list was curated based on the recent reports by pharma, research companies, WHO, ICMRs, China Health and other resources.
The list of drugs considered for interaction was paramterised and optimized considering desolvation terms, torsions as well as on understanding the binding affinities on key amino acids.

Results will be upload as .CSV file, you could contact me for SDF or other files at giribio#mail.com (replace # with @)

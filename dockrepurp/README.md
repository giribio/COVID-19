COVID-19 target: 6LU7 (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7) 
-The crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor N3.

In 6LU7 , target protease has cys-his catalytic dyad. 
Substrate binding site located between 
domain 1 (residues 8 to 101) and domain 2 (102 tp 184). 

Inhibitor forms antiparallel sheet with residues 164 to 168. Also with residues 189 to 191.

Key residues in binding pocket 
h41, y54, m49, d187, g143, c145, g143, q189, f185, h163, h164, a191, 
t190, q192, p168, l167, e166, h172, m165, n142, l141, f140. 

h41 and c145 are catalytic dyads required for protease activation.

Carried out molecular docking studies on 30 possible approved drugs.

The list was curated based on the recent reports by pharma, research companies, WHO, ICMRs, China Health and other resources.
The list of drugs considered for interaction as well as desolvation studies on understanding 
the binding affinity as follows:











Results are upload as .SDF file, for reference 30 compounds' SDF file is uploaded in 3D format.
The key amino acids in the protein 6LU7 contains:

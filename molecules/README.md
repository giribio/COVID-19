Small molecules collection from different resources.

Contact us for the curated dataset of antiviral compounds.

1. pH ionized

2. Desalted - retaining larger fragments

3. Maintained chiral centers and checked stereoisomers

4. Converted 2D to 3D structures using AMBER FF and optimized

5. Dataset of approx. 1,81,000 compounds (reported, purchasable, known compounds, FDA approved)

6. Similarity based, experiments and biologica data including pharmacophore screening.

7. Workflow of KNIME will be updated soon here and the narrowed down dataset in SMILES.
